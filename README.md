# Customer Churn Prediction

This project is a machine learning pipeline that predicts customer churn based on the [Telco Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn). The model uses a combination of data preprocessing and a `RandomForestClassifier`, built using Scikit-learn's `Pipeline`.

# Model Used

- RandomForestClassifier from Scikit-learn
- Integrated with full preprocessing using ColumnTransformer and Pipeline
